What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        lesson_1_reflections.txt
        lesson_2_reflections.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
